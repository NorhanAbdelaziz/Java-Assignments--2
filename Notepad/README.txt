Create a Frame-Based Application that carries out the basic
functionalities of a simple text editor.
• The application should feature a text area and a menu bar with
the following menus and menu items (with shortcuts):
 File: New (ctrl+N), Open (ctrl+O), Save (ctrl+S), Exit (ctrl+E).
 Edit: Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete, Select All.
 Help: About.
• The About Dialog should display short information about the
application and its version on multiple lines. It should also
have an “Ok” button that disposes the dialog.
Continue working on the Text Editor Application. Write the code
to open and save text files using either of the following set of
classes:
 FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
 DataInputStream and DataOutputStream
 FileReader and FileWriter (Bonus)
Note: File menu should contain: Save and Open using High
and Low Level Streams
