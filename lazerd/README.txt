Create a Desktop GUI Application that shows 4 panels laid out
as cards in front of each other. Each panel should have a label
indicating its order (1, 2, …4).
• At the bottom of the application there should be a panel with
one Choice component and four buttons.
• The four buttons are:
 Next: Shows the next panel in the sequence.
 Previous: Shows the previous panel in the sequence.
 First: Shows panel 1.
 Last: Shows panel 4.
• The choice allows the user to randomly select the index/name
of a certain panel to show.
